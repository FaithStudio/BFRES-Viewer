# BFRES-Viewer
A tool to view Switch BFRES files. With more functionally to come soon.

This is a fork of Ploaj's [ModelThingy](https://github.com/Ploaj/ModelThingy) but to work with switch BFRES files. 

This does not aim to be a full editor. That will be another tool with Syroot's library updated for full rebuilding.
For now this useful for viewing and ripping data when more features are added in.  

## Todo
* Texture swizzling. Started on but not finished.
* Export option for models to obj/dae.
* Export option for animations to smd/anim.
* Export option for texures (when swizzling is done) to png,tga, and other formats.
* Better controls


### Credits
* Ploaj for original tool and animation interpolation stuff. 
* Smb123w64gb which made imrpovements to the original tool. 
* RandomTalkingBush for his script that gave an idea on the layout that changed for the fromat
* Aboood40091 for swizzle code. (Not implimented fully yet)
